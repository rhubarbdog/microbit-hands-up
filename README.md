# microbit-hands-up
A classroom aid to the eternal problem of which hand went up first

Flash `teacher.py` to one microbit and `pupil.py` to each student's microbit.

When the teacher asks for "hands up", students press a button on their microbit.
The order in which the pressed is stored on the teacher's microbit.
The teacher presses a button to end the event.  Each further press of a button
by the teacher will display a happy face on the pupil's microbit's in the order
they were pressed.
